It had been a while since I've made a cursor set but here is the new one!


10 Cursors total, including two that have 16 frames of animation a piece.

Obviously inspired by Mac OS X's cursors, but I have taken the time to create
each of these from scratch using Photoshop CS2 and Axialis Cursor Workshop.


Hope you like them!
